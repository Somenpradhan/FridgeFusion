#  Fridge Fusion AI 🍳🥗 - Your Smart Kitchen Assistant
### A Personalized, Time-Aware & Inclusive Cooking Assistant

---

## 🌟 Overview
Fridge Fusion AI is a web-based application that aims to cut down food waste and make daily cooking easier. It uses **Artificial Intelligence** to help users decide what to cook based on the ingredients they already have by utilizing **Computer Vision** and **Large Language Models (LLMs)**.

Users can upload a picture of their open fridge or enter ingredients manually. The system then generates **easy-to-follow, personalized recipes** tailored to dietary preferences, available cooking time, and user age. This project showcases a practical AI solution focused on sustainability, accessibility, and personalization.

## 🔥 Features

### Ingredient Detection
- Upload a picture of your open fridge
- AI identifies visible ingredients using Vision APIs
- Manual ingredient entry available for flexibility

---

### Dietary Preference Awareness
- Supports both **Vegan** and **Non-Vegan** users
- Recipes strictly adhere to selected dietary choices

---

### Time & Mood-Based Cooking Modes
Users can select their cooking speed:
- **15-Minute Rush Mode**
- **Quick Recipe Mode**
- **Normal Cooking Mode**

The AI adjusts recipe steps, complexity, and prep time as needed.

---

### Age-Adaptive Recipe Explanation
- Users share their **age group**
- Recipes are explained in:
  - Simple and beginner-friendly terms
  - Clear, meaningful, and easy-to-follow steps
- Ensures accessibility for students, beginners, and older users

---

### Food Waste Reduction Focus
- Prioritizes ingredients that are nearing expiration
- Uses as many available items as possible
- Suggests **only one missing ingredient** if necessary

---

## Why AI?
- **Computer Vision APIs** detect ingredients from images
- **Large Language Models (LLMs)** generate smart, tailored recipes
- Prompt engineering allows for personalization based on:
  - Diet
  - Time
  - Age
  - Recipe tone and complexity

---
